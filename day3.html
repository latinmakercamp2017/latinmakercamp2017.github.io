  <h3>Carvey!</h3>
  <p>The Carvey is a desktop CNC machine. It works kind of like the vinyl cutter, but with a drill bit instead of a blade, and it is capable of cutting (or carving) through a much wider variety of materials. The Carvey is capable of cutting through wood, plastic, and even metal. Much like the vinyl cutter, the
    Carvey just interprets a series of movements - called the "toolpath" - from a controlling computer. Unlike the vinyl cutter, the Carvey operates in three dimensions - meaning you control how deeply you carve into the material you're working with.</p>

    <h3>Carvey Project #1</h3>
    <p>Design a coaster! Use Mr. Stone's Coaster as a template (go to File -> Make a Copy). Make sure to rename it by clicking the name at the top.<p>
    <p>The coaster is already sized at 3.5 x 3.5 inches with a through-cut all the way around. Add whatever elements you'd like, but remember that you need to keep them large enough for the blade to actually carve out - any sections the blade will skip will be highlighted in red on the preview screen.</p>

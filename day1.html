<h3>Intro to Tinkercad</h3>  

<p><a href="http://tinkercad.com" target="_blank">Tinkercad</a> is a simple, online 3D design tool. It will be the foundation for most of the work that you will be designing for the 3D printer. We will be using a shared login to Tinkercad for our activities this week. The login information for Tinkercad is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Login: latinmakercamp2017</li>
  <li>Password: latinmakercamp2017</li>
</ul>

<p>Some things to remember about Tinkercad:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Always rename your project! Please include your last name so I know who it belongs to.</li>
    <li>Tinkercad saves automatically so you don't have to.</li>
    <li>You can always UNDO something you did!</li>
  </ol>

<h3> Tinkerad Challenge Project </h3>
  <p> We will be designing custom 3D printed rings! This means we will have to measure our hands and size our rings appropriately in Tinkercad. The key is to make sure that the INSIDE of your ring is slightly larger than the measured diameter of your finger! Don't make your ring too small or you might find you can get it on but you can't get it off! </p>
<h3>3D Printing</h3>

<p>3D printing is the creation of a real-world, physical model from a 3D design. The process we will be using is called FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling), and it builds 3D objects up from melted plastic layer by layer. In order for this kind of printer to work, the 3D model has to be "sliced" into the individual layers, and then each layer translated into a series of movements for the 3D printer to execute.</p>

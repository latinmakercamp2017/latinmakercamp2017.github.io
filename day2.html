<h3>Vectors and Bitmaps</h3>
<p>Today we are going to be creating vector artwork. Most of the graphic files you'll find on the Internet are "bitmap" images - this means that the color value for each pixel is stored independently. Vector images, on the other hand, use mathematical equations to describe the various lines, curves, and points that make up an image. A computer than uses these equations to draw the image you see on the screen. In order to be used with most of the tools in the Makerspace, graphics must be in a vector format.</p>
<p>Later today, we'll look at how we can convert images we find on the Internet into vector artwork, but first we're going to take a look at some basics of creating our own vector artwork, and how that artwork can be transformed into objects created using the vinyl cutter and carving machine.</p>

<h3>Vinyl Cutter</h3>
<p>The vinyl cutter is a tool that translates a 2D image file from the computer into a series of "cuts" on a piece of material. Most commonly, this is adhesive vinyl that can be used to create stickers and decals, but the vinyl cutter can also create iron-on patches, rubber stamp templates, glass etching templates and many other objects.</p>
<p>Much like the 3D printer, the vinyl cutter requires that image files created in another program be prepared for the cutter in a special piece of software.</p?
<p>Things to keep in mind about the vinyl cutter:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The vinyl cutter only cuts lines - you still have to determine what parts of the cut decal you want to keep and what parts need to be removed to create your finished piece.</li>
  <li>The vinyl cutter can only cut in one color, but you can create multiple decals and layer or arrange them in a particular fashion when applying them to the final surface to create multicolor effects.</li>
  <li>The vinyl cutter works fast! The 3D printer can take hours to create a single finished object, but even very large or detailed cuts rarely take longer than 10 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Vinyl Cutter Project #1</h3>
<p>Make a sign for your door! It shoud have your name, at least one shape or graphic, and at least one slogan or message - "Keep Out!" or "Beware of Dog". It can be up to 12 inches by 6 inches.</p>
